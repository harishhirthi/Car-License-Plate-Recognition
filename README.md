# Car-License-Plate-Recognition
The motive is to localize the license plate and recognize license text and number from the plate.

## Description:
**Object Detection** is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos. Thus with the help of object detection, license plates are localized and **OCR[Optical Character Recognition]** which is the method to extract text from the region of interest, is used to extract the license text from the localized plate.
